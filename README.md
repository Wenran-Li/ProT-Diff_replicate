# ProT-Diff_replicate
I should depart the encoder and decoder, because I need sandwich a diffusion model between them.

To be honest:
step 1. encoder: sequence to features
step 2. diffusion: features to new features
step 3. decoder: featrues to new sequence

I have finished the first two steps, but faild at the third step, please give me some advice. Thank you!
